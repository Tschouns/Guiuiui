=== Guiuiui Mini Roadmap ===

= "AddRemove" =

= "ListView" =

= "ViewModel" =
X Implement "Get only" data binding
* Provide method overloads to bind a control with a specific text converter / parser
* Provide API for custom control extensions ("BBT Money Control", "BBT Data Selector", and such...)
* Complete WinForms ControlAdapters for
  X Label
  X TextBox
  X ComboBox
  X CheckBox
  * DatePicker
  X "Child List Controls"

= "Tools" =
X Provide API for custom text converters
* Provide API for custom parsers
* Complete Parsers for .Net base types
  * bool
  X int
  * double
  * decimal
  * byte
  * long
  * ...

* Provide data binding/view model/adapters etc. in separate projects for WinForms and WPF

=== Tech.Features ===
* Data binding: take in Expressions instead of Func/Action, then compile them
  * to enforce a more readable "expression-style" usage, and...
  * to determine a "PropertyInfo" (which can then be used/evaluated by other tools -> Extendability)
